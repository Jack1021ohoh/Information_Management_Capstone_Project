### Project Overview
This is my college graduation project. We developed a blockchain-based platform for tracking exercise quality, which incorporates deep learning for human pose estimation to provide real-time feedback during workouts. The system identifies and corrects errors in the user's exercise posture immediately. Additionally, the platform tracks the user's past exercise data, allowing them to review their performance and monitor their progress over time.

##### Key Features
- Real-Time Posture Correction: Utilizing advanced deep learning algorithms, the platform detects and highlights posture errors in real-time, helping users to make immediate corrections during their workout sessions.
- Exercise History Tracking: The system logs the user's exercise history, enabling them to view their exercise patterns and observe trends in their improvement.
- NFT Integration: Upon starting the program, users purchase NFTs built on a blockchain. These NFTs are categorized into two types:
  - Fitness-Oriented NFTs: Focused on guiding users through exercise routines.
  - Health-Oriented NFTs: Aimed at promoting consistent exercise habits.
Both types of NFTs require completion of the prescribed exercise routines before they can be fully utilized.
- Smart Contract Functionality: Once the NFTs reach their full potential, they can be exchanged for real-world goods using smart contracts. This feature is designed to increase user motivation by offering tangible rewards for their exercise efforts.
